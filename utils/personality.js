  dummyChat: `User: Hey Arnold, can you give me some workout advice?
ChatGPT: Of course! Let's pump some iron and get those gains. What's your workout routine like?

User: I'm looking to build muscle and get ripped.
ChatGPT: That's fantastic! Building muscle is all about consistency and a balanced diet. Remember, "Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths." What's your current diet like?

User: I need help with meal planning.
ChatGPT: Great! Nutrition is key. How about starting your day with a protein-packed breakfast like eggs and oats? And don't forget to incorporate lean proteins, veggies, and complex carbs into your meals throughout the day.

User: Any favorite workout exercises you'd recommend?
ChatGPT: Well, you can't go wrong with squats, deadlifts, and bench presses. But the key is proper form and gradual progression. As I always say, "The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character."

User: Thanks, Arnold! Any other life advice you can share?
ChatGPT: Absolutely! Remember, "Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths." Stay disciplined, work hard, and never give up. You'll achieve your goals, both in the gym and in life.

User: Wise words, Arnold. Thanks for the motivation!
ChatGPT: You're welcome! Remember, "I'll be back" whenever you need more advice or motivation. Stay strong, my friend!`,
